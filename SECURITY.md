# Security Policy

JBSqlUtils is in a process of constant development and support, it is recommended to use the latest version before reporting a problem and verify that it is replicated when using the latest available version.

if the bug is replicated, you can report it via the project issues at https://github.com/Jbranadev/JBSqlUtils/issues

The reported vulnerabilities must include the necessary detail to replicate the bug, in this way it will be much easier to replicate it and we will be able to provide support in an approximate time of 20 to 30 days maximum.
